Collection of assignments from a Lab Course which uses outdated methods coz the curriculum and the professor were both ass

## Assignment questions

### 0801 - Installation
```
Understanding the syntax and attempting few shapes . 
BaseCode.cpp to use in further applications.
```

### 0808 - Basic Functionalities
```
1. Draw House (E.g. Animation of changing the color of the different components of the house on keyboard/mouse event. You can try other animations as you wish.)

2. Draw Car (E.g. Animation of Car moving on mouse/keyborad event. You can try other
animations as you wish.)
```

### 0822 - Complex Shapes
```
1. Draw ICG. The color of the letters can be taken as random such that everytime you press a Key or Mouse click, new random color would be generated for each letter.

2. Draw the last two digits of your roll number. For example, if your roll number is CED19I001, you need to draw 01. The color of the letters can be taken as random such that everytime you press a Key or Mouse click, new random color would be generated for each letter.
```

### 0829 - Line Drawing Algorithms

```
1. Use DDA and Breshnam line drawing (BLD) algorithms to draw a regular hexagon.

2. Draw a house using DDA and Breshnam line drawing (BLD) algorithm.
```

### 0905 - Mid Point Circle Drawing Algorithm
```
1. Use Breshnham Line Drawing (BLD) and Mid-point Circle Drawing (MCD) algorithms to draw a car. (Use the BLD code directly from the last lab, use the car coordinates from previous labs). For MCD algorithm, you need to use the decision parameters of Octant-1.

2. Use Mid-point Circle Drawing (MCD) algorithm (of privious question) to draw the following arc AB (as show in the figure) with radius r, starting angle α, sweeping angle β. Angles are taken in anti-clockwise direction. (-2л<=л<=α<=2л<=л and -2л<=л<=β<=2л<=л). Input to the algorithm are radius and center of the arc, α and β (degree)

### 0919 - Mid-point Ellipse/Parabola Drawing Algorithm
```
1. Use the Mid-point algorithm to draw a vertical up parabola. The Vertex, color, focal length should be taken as random input. Everytime you click the mouse/enter a key, a new random parabola will be generated.

2. Use Mid-point Ellipse Drawing (MED) algorithm to draw the an elliptical arc (as show in the figure) with major axis length 2a and minor axis length 2b, starting angle α, sweeping angle β. Angles are taken in anti-clockwise direction. (-2л<=α<=2л and -2л<=β<=2л). Input to the algorithm are major, minor axis lengths, center of the arc, α and β in degrees. All the inputs should be random. Everytime you click the mouse/enter a key, a new elliptical arc will be generated.
